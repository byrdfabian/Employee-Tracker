# Employee Tracker

To make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in a datatbase, I have created
an interface known as a Content Management System. With this resource, I was able to provide a solution for 
managaging a company's employees.

## User Story
AS AN employeer
I WANT to be able to track and manage multiple resources
GIVEN a functioning Content Management System that contains employee, role, and department information
SO THAT I can manage, manuever, and allocate resources through the Command Line
Where I use the CMS I am able to veiw departments, roles, and employees
When I want to Creation, Update, or Delete any of the resources I can perform these actions from the Command Line
```
